The object of the game is for two players to compete with one another in order to achieve 100 points first. 
This project provides players with an entertaining and engaging method to play a traditional dice game, 
complete with strategic components and dynamic visual feedback to improve the gameplay. 
providing lively gameplay Rolling the Dice: By selecting the "Roll Dice" option, players may roll virtual dice. 
The result is produced at random, mimicking a genuine dice roll. Updated in real time, the player's current score is increased with each roll. 
Rolling a 1 ends the current player's turn and instantly transfers control to the next player. ## Participating
